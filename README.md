# A-Novel-Automatic-Shot-Boundary-Detection-Algorithm-Robust-to-Illumination-and-Motion-Effect
A novel method for SBD using LBP-HF and Canny edge difference




This system is divided into a two stages as described in a paper A Novel Automatic Shot Boundary Detection Algorithm Robust to : Illumination and Motion Effect.

First Stage
Bolckwise LBP-HF is used for finding dissimilarity difference between consecutive frames and marking probable abrupt transition

Second stage

Blockwise canny edge difference between the corresponding blocks of consecutive frame is calculated and this stage is used as confirmation stage.
